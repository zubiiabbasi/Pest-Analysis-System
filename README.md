# Pest-Analysis-System
 “Pestcouts” is an emerging pesticide (insect killer) research lab. They are aiming at producing environmentally friendly pesticides. Currently they are conducting tests for a new formula on a farmhouse. They divided the farmhouse into 4 fields. They have conducted a test and recorded the success scores. Scores are sent to the system one by one and stored in a table as shown below.
In the below data table, tests are being conducted in 4 fields. Each field corresponds to a row and each test value corresponds to column of data. 

Field 1	5	1	21	-1	-1	-1
Field 2	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1
Field 3	23	5	20	5	30	-1
Field 4	1	9	5	0	-1	-1

Note:  -1 shows that field is empty.
1.	Insert a new value in any field of table at first empty location.
2.	Count the number of filled locations (values other than -1) in whole table.
3.	Delete any filled value from any field.( Deletion means replace with -1)
4.	Find and display the top two values in whole data (excluding -1) which have maximum occurrences. For example, in the given data table above, 5 has maximum occurrence of 4 times while 1 has second maximum occurrence of 2 times.
5.	Calculate Average test score of all the field values (excluding empty locations).
6.	Tell the field/s no having maximum success scores value.
